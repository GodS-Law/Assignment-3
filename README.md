# Assignment-3
TASK 1 wil not work for any value below 0
TASK 2 will show an error for any input less than equals to 0

TASK 1
First we take input from the user and save its value in "value" variable.
Then, there is a variable "val" for helping the calculations and holds the value of 1 initially.
(made it global)
Next, We define a function name "trial()" in this function we run for loop till the inputed value + 1 using "range()" function.
And for each number between 1 to inputed value, this funtion multiply itself with that number.
and after the for loop exits then it prints the final value of "val"
And lastly we run the "trial()" function with inputed value.

TASK 2
First we import maths module. Then we tak ethe input from the user.
after that we define a funtion which will use the inputed value and calculate and print simultaneously using sqrt(), log() and sin() functions of maths module.
